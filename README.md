# PySide6 playground
This is currently just a playground for learning Qt/PySide6 while reading the book *Create GUI Applications with Python & Qt6* by Martin Fitzpatrick.

## Notes
* `gtk3-icon-browser` can be used for browsing icons in the distro's theme. It can be installed with `apt install gtk-3-examples`.
  * Get the icons in Qt by calling the function `QtGui.QIcon.fromTheme(name: str)`.
